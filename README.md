# Fifa-World-Cup

The FIFA World Cup is an international football competition where countries
qualify to send teams made up of the best players from each nation to obtain
the World Cup Championship. It has been awarded every four years since the
inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it wasn't held due
to the Second World War. The current format of the tournament involves 32 teams
competing for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of one
month.
