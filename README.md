# Data Analysis of FIFA World Cups 1930 - 2014.

For this project I analyzed data from the FIFA World Cups between 1930 and 2014. 
This tournament is an international football competition where countries
qualify to send teams made up of the best players from each nation to obtain
the World Cup Championship. It has been awarded every four years since the
inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it wasn't held due
to the Second World War. The current format of the tournament involves 32 teams
competing for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of one
month.

Throughout the project you will be able to find:

* Data cleaning and standardization of countries names.
* Analysis of World Cup Winners 1930 - 2014.
* Visualization of matches played and teams qualified per World Cup over the years.
* Analysis of the distribution of goals per match.
* Analysis of average and total goals scored for an specific team throughout its World Cup participations.
