The FIFA World Cup, or simply the World Cup, is an international f√∫tbol competition

The World Cup championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural 
tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the
Second World War.The current format of the tournament involves 32 teams competing
for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of one month.
